<!-- This would be a binary favicon file generated from your images -->
<!-- Since I cannot create binary files, you'll need to:
1. Use an online favicon generator like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net
2. Upload your black and white portrait images
3. Generate the favicon package
4. Replace the existing favicon files in the public folder -->
